# NYSK_Analysis
Scala Project


We want to perform an automatic classification of a set of about
10,000 articles published in May 2011 and related to the DSK case in New York.
To do so, we must first choose a method allowing a numerical representation of each
numerical representation of each article, then apply a classification algorithm to the
classification algorithm to the obtained representation.
